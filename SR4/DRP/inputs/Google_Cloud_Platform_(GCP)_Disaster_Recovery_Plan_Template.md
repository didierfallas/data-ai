# **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Disaster Recovery Plan Template**

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is to provide a clear and systematic approach to ensure the continuity and recovery of critical services and data hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in the event of a disaster.

### **1.2 Scope**

This plan covers all critical systems and services hosted on GCP, including but not limited to Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, and Firestore.

## **2\. Objectives**

* Ensure the availability and continuity of critical business functions.  
* Minimize the impact of disasters on operations.  
* Define roles and responsibilities for disaster recovery.  
* Establish a process for regular testing and updating of the DRP.

## **3\. Disaster Recovery Team**

| Role | Name | Contact Information |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| DR Coordinator | \[Name\] | \[Email, Phone\] |
| IT Manager | \[Name\] | \[Email, Phone\] |
| Cloud Admin | \[Name\] | \[Email, Phone\] |
| Network Engineer | \[Name\] | \[Email, Phone\] |
| Database Admin | \[Name\] | \[Email, Phone\] |
| Application Owner | \[Name\] | \[Email, Phone\] |

## **4\. Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis**

### **4.1 Risk Assessment**

Identify potential risks that could impact GCP services, including natural disasters, cyber-attacks, hardware failures, and human errors.

### **4.2 Business Impact Analysis**

Evaluate the impact of potential disasters on business operations. Identify critical services and their Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).

| Service | RTO | RPO | Impact Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Compute Engine | \[X\] | \[Y\] | \[Impact description\] |
| Cloud SQL | \[X\] | \[Y\] | \[Impact description\] |
| Cloud Storage | \[X\] | \[Y\] | \[Impact description\] |
| Firestore | \[X\] | \[Y\] | \[Impact description\] |

## **5\. Disaster Recovery Strategies**

### **5.1 Data Backup**

* Regularly back up all critical data.  
* Use GCP's native backup solutions for Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, and Firestore.  
* Store backups in a separate GCP region.

### **5.2 High Availability**

* Deploy services across multiple zones and regions.  
* Use managed services with built-in high availability (e.g., Cloud SQL with replication).

### **5.3 Redundancy**

* Implement redundant systems for critical components.  
* Use load balancers to distribute traffic.

### **5.4 Automation**

* Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform) to automate the deployment and recovery processes.

### **5.5 Testing and Validation**

* Conduct regular disaster recovery drills.  
* Test backups and failover processes.

## **6\. Disaster Recovery Procedures**

### **6.1 Incident Identification and Notification**

* Monitor GCP services using Cloud Monitoring.  
* Define thresholds for alerts.  
* Notify the DR team upon detection of a disaster.

### **6.2 Disaster Declaration**

* Criteria for declaring a disaster.  
* Steps to declare a disaster.

### **6.3 Recovery Steps**

#### **6.3.1 Compute Engine**

* Stop affected instances.  
* Restore instances from backups or snapshots.  
* Verify instance functionality.

#### **6.3.2 Cloud SQL**

* Restore the database from backups.  
* Switch to the standby replica if using replication.  
* Verify database integrity.

#### **6.3.3 Cloud Storage**

* Restore data from backup buckets.  
* Verify data integrity.

#### **6.3.4 Firestore**

* Restore Firestore data from backups.  
* Verify data consistency and integrity.

### **6.4 Communication Plan**

* Notify stakeholders of the disaster and recovery status.  
* Provide regular updates to business units and customers.

### **6.5 Post-Recovery Steps**

* Conduct a post-mortem analysis.  
* Identify areas for improvement.  
* Update the DRP based on lessons learned.

## **7\. Plan Maintenance**

* Review and update the DRP annually or after any significant changes.  
* Conduct regular training for the DR team.  
* Document and archive all changes to the DRP.

## **8\. Appendices**

### **Appendix A: Contact List**

* List of all relevant contacts, including external vendors and support teams.

### **Appendix B: DRP Change Log**

* Record of all changes made to the DRP.

### **Appendix C: Glossary**

* Definitions of terms and acronyms used in the DRP.
