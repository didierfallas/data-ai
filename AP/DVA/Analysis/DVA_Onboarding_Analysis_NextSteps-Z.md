# DVA Onboarding Analysis - Next Steps

## Priority Areas to Evaluate:

### 1. Critical Technical Decisions
- Multi-tenant Firebase Auth implementation details
- Data isolation strategy between tenants
- AI cost tracking and allocation mechanisms

### 2. Missing Technical Specifications
- Detailed RBAC matrix (screens/actions vs permissions)
- Data validation and conflict resolution policies
- API rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Error handling and user notification strategies

### 3. Security & Compliance Gaps
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Audit trail requirements
- PII handling and compliance standards
- Session management and timeout policies

### 4. Operational Considerations
- Deployment strategy across environments
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring thresholds

### 5. Integration Dependencies
- Stripe payment flow validation
- SFTP requirements and file processing pipelines
- Third-party service integrations beyond Firebase

## Recommended Next Steps:

### 1. Immediate Actions
- Conduct stakeholder interviews to clarify open questions
- Create detailed technical specifications for each section
- Define MVP scope and delivery timeline

### 2. Technical Deep-Dive
- Prototype Firebase Auth multi-tenant setup
- Design database schema with tenant isolation
- Implement basic RBAC framework

### 3. Documentation Enhancement
- Add system architecture diagrams
- Create detailed user journey flows
- Document error handling and edge cases

### 4. Risk Assessment
- Identify technical blockers and dependencies
- Evaluate vendor limitations (Firebase, Stripe)
- Plan security review and compliance validation

## Action Items Checklist

- [ ] Design storage architecture (single vs multi-bucket approach)
- [ ] Define API authentication strategy and rate limiting policies
- [ ] Specify subscription plan tiers and feature restrictions
- [ ] Verify current git repository structure and branching strategy
- [ ] Research Stripe Firebase extension for payment integration
- [ ] Design analytics implementation with GA4 and BigQuery integration

### Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Create system architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document user journey flows
